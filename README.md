<h1>📊 Sales Analysis - AdventureWorks</h1>

<p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p>
<p>
This project analyzes sales data from the AdventureWorks dataset, following a structured data analysis 
approach to uncover key business insights related to sales trends, order performance, and sales drivers.
</p>

<h2>🔎 1. Ask - Defining the Business Problem</h2>
<p>
To support data-driven decision-making, this analysis explores key business questions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the monthly sales trends?</li>
  <li>How do online and non-online sales compare?</li>
  <li>How efficient is the order delivery process?</li>
  <li>Who are the top salespeople by revenue and volume?</li>
  <li>Which countries generate the most sales?</li>
  <li>What are the primary reasons customers make purchases?</li>
</ul>

<h2>📂 2. Prepare - Understanding the Dataset</h2>
<p>
The analysis is based on sales transaction data from AdventureWorks, with key datasets including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sales Order Header</strong> - Order details and metadata</li>
  <li><strong>Sales Reason</strong> - Customer purchase reasons</li>
  <li><strong>Employee</strong> - Sales representatives and contacts</li>
  <li><strong>Sales Territory</strong> - Geographic sales data</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ 3. Process - Data Cleaning & Transformation</h2>
<p>
To ensure accurate analysis, the following data preparation techniques were applied:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Removed redundant columns to improve performance</li>
  <li>Standardized date formats for time-based analysis</li>
  <li>Validated data integrity using VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH</li>
  <li>Applied conditional formatting to highlight key trends</li>
</ul>

<h2>📊 4. Analyze - Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Seasonal Sales Trends:</strong> Q1, especially January, is the weakest period for revenue, while Q3 (August and May) sees peak performance. This highlights opportunities for seasonal promotions or demand forecasting adjustments.</li>
  <li><strong>Regional Performance Disparities:</strong> The US generates the highest sales, while Germany underperforms. Additionally, Australia leads in online orders, whereas Northeast, Central, and Southeast regions show little online activity. This suggests potential market expansion or strategy adjustments.</li>
  <li><strong>Sales Drivers & Customer Behavior:</strong> "Price" is the strongest motivator for purchases, driving the most revenue, while "Television Advertisement" has minimal impact. This insight can inform pricing strategies and marketing budget allocation.</li>
  <li><strong>Delivery Efficiency & Logistics Challenges:</strong> 99.97% of orders are delivered within 7 days, but Germany experiences longer delivery times. Addressing logistics in this region could enhance customer satisfaction and reduce delays.</li>
</ul>

<h2>📢 5. Share - Data Visualization & Presentation</h2>
<p>
Key trends and insights were presented using:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pivot Tables</strong> - To summarize data and analyze trends</li>
  <li><strong>Charts & Graphs</strong> - To visualize sales trends and comparisons</li>
  <li><strong>Conditional Formatting</strong> - To highlight important patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>
Visuals and reports are available in the <strong>visuals</strong> folder.
</p>

<h2>🚀 6. Act - Business Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Optimize pricing strategies based on seasonal demand fluctuations</li>
  <li>Investigate logistics challenges in Germany to improve delivery efficiency</li>
  <li>Reassess the effectiveness of TV advertisements, as they generate minimal sales</li>
  <li>Encourage online adoption in underperforming regions (Northeast, Central, Southeast)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>🔗 Next Steps:</strong> Further exploration could include customer segmentation analysis and promotional campaign impact assessment.</p>
