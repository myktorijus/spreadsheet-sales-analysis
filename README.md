<h1>📊 Sales Analysis - AdventureWorks</h1>

<p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p>
<p>
This project analyzes sales data from the AdventureWorks dataset, providing key business insights into 
monthly sales trends, order performance, and sales drivers.
</p>

<h2>🔍 Business Questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>What are the monthly sales trends?</li>
  <li>How do online and non-online sales compare?</li>
  <li>What is the delivery performance trend (order vs. ship date)?</li>
  <li>Who are the top salespeople by revenue and volume?</li>
  <li>Which countries generate the most sales?</li>
  <li>What are the top sales reasons?</li>
</ul>

<h2>📂 Dataset</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sales Order Header</strong> - Order details and metadata</li>
  <li><strong>Sales Reason</strong> - Customer purchase reasons</li>
  <li><strong>Employee</strong> - Sales representatives and contacts</li>
  <li><strong>Sales Territory</strong> - Geographic sales data</li>
</ul>

<h2>📊 Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Seasonal Sales Trends: Q1, especially January, is the weakest period for revenue, while Q3 (August and May) sees peak performance. This highlights opportunities for seasonal promotions or demand forecasting adjustments.</li>
  <li>Regional Performance Disparities: The US generates the highest sales, while Germany underperforms. Additionally, Australia leads in online orders, whereas Northeast, Central, and Southeast regions show little online activity. This suggests potential market expansion or strategy adjustments.</li>
  <li>Sales Drivers & Customer Behavior: "Price" is the strongest motivator for purchases, driving the most revenue, while "Television Advertisement" has minimal impact. This insight can inform pricing strategies and marketing budget allocation.</li>
  <li>Delivery Efficiency & Logistics Challenges: 99.97% of orders are delivered within 7 days, but Germany experiences longer delivery times. Addressing logistics in this region could enhance customer satisfaction and reduce delays.</li>
